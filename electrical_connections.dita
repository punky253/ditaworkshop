        <context>Perform the following instructions to setup the electrical connections for
            peripheral devices attaching to the TRS-80 computer<p/></context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd> Turn the TRS-80so that it faces away from you. Locate the port Door (<ph
                        conref="parts_list.dita#parts_list/ph_mph_rp4_w1c"/> ); it's at the right
                    end of the rear pane</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>To remove the Door, raise it up and slide it to the rightâ€”then lift it up and
                    away from the TRS-80</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Place the TRS-80and Expansion Interface Hoods (1400217 and 1400214 ) on the
                    Ribbon Cable Connectors as shown in Figure 4. The Hoods replace the Door on the
                    TRS-80and fill the opening on the Expansion Interface. These Hoods are designed
                    so that it is not possible to insert the connectors upside down. They function
                    as keyways for the connectors.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd> Now connect the Ribbon Cable between the left front Expansion Interfaceport
                    and the TRS-80 port.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd> Connect the DC Power Cord (DIN connector) to the POWER connector on the right
                    rear of the TRS-80and connect both AC Power Cords to standard 120 VAC
                    outlets.</cmd>
            </step>
